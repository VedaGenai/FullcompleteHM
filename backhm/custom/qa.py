Basic Information:
- Position Title: [Job Title]
- Required Experience: [X years]
- Location: [City, State/Country]
- Contact: [Email and/or Phone if available]
- Position Type: [Contract or Permanent]
- Department: [Department name]
- Office Timings: [Morning shift or Night shift]
- Education Requirements: [Required education level]

For Dashboard #1 (Required Skills):
Extract key technical skills with their importance (%), selection score (%), rejection score (%), and rating (out of 10).

For the remaining {remaining_dashboards} dashboards, extract different categories of job requirements. These could include but are not limited to:
- Technical qualifications
- Soft skills
- Certifications
- Domain knowledge
- Industry experience
- Management abilities
- Communication skills
- Project management skills
- Cloud/infrastructure expertise
- Specialized tools proficiency

For EACH dashboard category, provide:
- Category name (e.g., "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills", "Certifications")
- 3-7 items within that category
- For each item: Name, Importance (%), Selection Score (%), Rejection Score (%), Rating (out of 10)

Importance Score (Sum: 100% per category): Represents the relative priority of each item based on prominence in the job description.
Selection Score (Sum: 100% across all items): Indicates how much each item contributes to candidate selection.
Rejection Score (Sum: 100% across all items): Indicates how much lacking each item would impact candidate's rejection.
Rating: Score out of 10 calculated as (Importance ร 10 รท highest importance percentage in that category)

Format your response with CONSISTENT structure as follows with one blank line between each section:

Basic Information:
- Position Title: [Job Title]
- Required Experience: [X years]
- Location: [City, State/Country]
- Contact: [Email and/or Phone if available]

(Continue for all {num_dashboards} dashboards)

Rules:
- You MUST extract the position title, required experience, and location if available
- If exact years of experience aren't stated, estimate based on seniority level
- Importance percentages should sum to 100% within each category
- Selection and Rejection scores should each sum to 100% across all items
- Each dashboard category MUST be different and distinct
- if {num_dashboards} = 1, then only output Dashboard #1 - Required Skills, if {num_dashboards} = 2, then only output Dashboard #1 - Required Skills and Dashboard #2 - [Category Name]
- Each dashboard MUST have at least 3 items
- Numbers should be rounded to one decimal place
- If information for a requested dashboard is not available in the job description, create a relevant category that would be useful for this job position
- DO NOT include any threshold recommendations or benchmark values
- DO NOT include any suggested adjustments

Job Description:

# Updated template for question generation based on dashboards
qa_generation_template = """Here is a job description:

{context}

Based on this job description, generate {questions_per_dashboard} specific questions for each of the {num_dashboards} dashboard categories identified in the analysis. Each question should be directly related to skills or requirements in that dashboard category.

For each question, also provide:
- Which dashboard category it relates to (e.g., Required Skills, Technical Skills, Soft Skills)
- The importance level of the skill being assessed (High/Medium/Low based on importance percentage)
- A brief answer (2-3 sentences) based only on information in the job description

Format your response exactly as follows:

DASHBOARD 1 QUESTIONS:
Q1.1: [Question]
Category: [Dashboard Category]
Skill Importance: [High/Medium/Low]
A1.1: [Answer]

Q1.2: [Question]
Category: [Dashboard Category]
Skill Importance: [High/Medium/Low]
A1.2: [Answer]

DASHBOARD 2 QUESTIONS:
Q2.1: [Question]
Category: [Dashboard Category]
Skill Importance: [High/Medium/Low]
A2.1: [Answer]

And so on for all dashboards and questions.

The questions should focus on:
- Skills with highest importance percentages
- Critical requirements for the role
- Specific technical competencies
- Relevant experience requirements
- Problem-solving approaches needed for the position

If the job description doesn't provide information for a particular answer, begin with "The job description doesn't specify this, but..." and then make a reasonable inference.

Ensure questions are distributed across all dashboard categories, with emphasis on skills with higher importance ratings.
